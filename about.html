<h5>Order Online</h5>
<p>MIA LACE COLLECTIONS started as an online store, and it remains the only place to buy an authentic gown outside of our showroom. We continue to work hard to provide an exceptional online experience hand-in-hand with our expert team of online stylists who are available around-the-clock to help you with your styling needs.</p>

<h5>Luxury Fabrics</h5>
<p>Above all, we believe in two things: high quality, luxury sustainably sourced fabrics and ethical, handmade manufacturing. We only use the finest laces, silks, embroideries and trims and proudly uphold our reputation for being the best at what we do.</p>

<h5>Our Gowns</h5>
<p>Our gowns are crafted for comfort and movement. Our designs are all originally created and brought to life by our in-house production team. We introduced an innovative and modern way of designing and constructing wedding dresses. We steer clear of boning or corsetry and opt for 'stretch' instead - designing unique silhouettes which allow you to move, laugh and dance, freely. Our gowns work with your body, not against it.</p>

  <p>“I purchased my gown online (everybody thought I was crazy) but it was so smooth sailing! I had my mum take my measurements, emailed them in to Grace Loves Lace and ta-da… I had my dress 3 months later. My gown fit perfectly and communicating with the GLL stylists half way across the world was an absolute breeze!”</p>

  <p>“The Inca made me feel amazing with my shape and size. When I first tried it on I was a little nervous because I had only seen slim girls in it, but when I put it on and looked in the mirror I just fell more in love with it! It actually made my curves look better… the style, cut, lace and design was SO flattering on my body!”</p>
