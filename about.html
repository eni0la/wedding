    <p>Disillusioned with the structured, traditional wedding ‘uniform’ that dominated the market, we set out to change the bridal industry. We believed that quality shouldn’t be dictated by a price tag, and that a woman shouldn’t be forced to sacrifice style for comfort. We thought that the brides of today deserved better than average…
<br> <br>
    And so, it began the story of MIA LACE COLLECTIONS. Since then, our team has created a whole new perspective on bridal dressing and have been designing gowns we want women to feel confident and empowered in. Our handmade gowns are all about effortless luxury, quality and style. We design gowns that have soul, originality and authenticity.
<br> <br>
“The woman we design for is at the core of everything we do. She is effortlessly sophisticated, captivating, down to earth, sexy and authentic. She’s warm as the Spanish sun and cool as the Californian night. The woman has morals and values – she knows exactly what inspires and motivates her.”

  <p>“I purchased my gown online (everybody thought I was crazy) but it was so smooth sailing! I had my mum take my measurements, emailed them in to MIA LACE COLLECTIONS and ta-da… I had my dress 3 months later. My gown fit perfectly and communicating with the stylists half way across the world was an absolute breeze!”</p>

  <p>“The Inca made me feel amazing with my shape and size. When I first tried it on I was a little nervous because I had only seen slim girls in it, but when I put it on and looked in the mirror I just fell more in love with it! It actually made my curves look better… the style, cut, lace and design was SO flattering on my body!”</p>
