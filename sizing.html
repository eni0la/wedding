     <h3>SIZING AND ORDERING</h3>
    <div class="order">
      <h4>STANDARD MADE TO ORDER</h4>
      <p>If your wedding is more than 4 months away, you are a Standard Made-to-Order bride. Your gown will be handmade especially for you in our studio to your size range and height. Your measurements will determine the sizing and proportions that best suit you. Your order will be dispatched approximately 6-8 weeks before your wedding date.

    <div class="order">
      <h4>PRIORITY MADE TO ORDER</h4>
      <p>If your wedding is less than 4 months away, our team will need to organise a priority order for a Made-to-Order gown. For an additional fee, your gown will be handmade especially for you in our studio to your size ranges and height. Your measurements will determine the sizing and proportions that best suit you. As your gown will move immediately into production you must provide all measurements at the time of placing the order to guarantee an on-time delivery. Failure to provide all measurements at the time of placing the order may result in your gown being delayed, a fault not assumed by MIA. If the measurements are provided at the time of placing the order, your order will arrive no less than seven days before your wedding date. <br><br>
        If your wedding is less than 6 weeks away, we have a selection of online sample gowns made according to standard sizes and a standard height which are available for dispatch in 2 – 3 business days. Please email  <a href=" mialacecollections@gmail.com">mialacecollections@gmail.com</a>  or call our office +1 801 692 7701 to speak with our Online Stylist team.
