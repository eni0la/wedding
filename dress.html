	<h3>WEDDING DRESSES</h3>
	<p>Finding the wedding dress of your dreams is an experience that you will remember forever. We’re so thrilled to invite you into our world of ethical bridal luxury! Every MIA LACE COLLECTION gown is handcrafted with love and each of our showrooms feels like home. As the pinnacle destination for all things wedding and events, we develop collections in-house and we don’t follow trends. Instead, we innovate and create. We achieve this by hand-sketching our ideas, hand-draping fabrics and trims on the mannequin, pattern making by hand and sewing our own samples. Essentially, we have a slow and considered process that results in the ultimate fit and quality in world-class designs.
<br><br>
		Whether your personal style is simple, classic, bohemian, luxe or romantic, we have a dress that is perfectly suited to you. Our experienced online and showroom stylists will provide you with unrivalled service so you can find the dress of your dreams for your wedding day. Your bridal silhouette will be the first decision you’ll make in your wedding journey. If you’re looking for a dramatic, fit-and-flare, mermaid, figure-hugging or effortless style, we have the wedding dress for you. Your bridal style might be an off-the-shoulder look, or  high neck wedding gown. In general, brides adore the traditional strapless gown for a summer wedding, while a winter wedding is perfect for a long sleeved gown. We even have your second wedding dress if you choose to take two. <br><br>
		
		While silhouette is paramount, bridal dressing is all about the details. This includes hand sewn artisanal motifs which is our signature look. Above all, comfort and luxury are our defining qualities. Each of our gowns is handmade in Burleigh Heads, Australia. It is our mission to infuse ethics with beautiful design, creating a real connection between the skilled maker and the bride. This is what makes our studio so special – it’s where the magic happens! If you thought the showroom experience was the best part, the best is yet to come. Once you receive your dress, delivered straight to your door, the unboxing is the best part. Let’s get married!
	<br><br>
		Choosing a wedding dress is one of the most exciting yet stressful experiences a bride will make before her big day. Every bride has something specific in mind for their beautiful dress, whether it’s a simple silk dress or a statement low back piece, we know that we can find the right one for our brides.</p>

		<h3>SILHOUETTE</h3>
		<p>The silhouette is an exciting choice to make and it is often the first step to deciding on your dress. From the dramatic flair of a mermaid cut to a classy strapless or a flowing lace wedding dress, we can ensure you’re wearing the wedding dress you have always dreamed of.</p>
		<h3>STYLE</h3>
		<p>Necklines, sleeve length, fabric and colour are all important options to consider when choosing your dress. They will add the delicate touch of complimenting your figure, enhancing the sweep of your hair and the curve of your carefully chosen wedding shoes. At MIA LACE COLLECTIONS, we are proud to provide a wide range of wedding dresses to fulfil any wedding dress style our brides could desire.</p>
